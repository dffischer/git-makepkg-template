# Git Templates for makepkg-template

This repository collects templates for [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/)'s makepkg-template capturing most of the [VCS package guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VCS_package_guidelines) from the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/). They will

1. add git as a make dependency,
2. care for the built package to provide and conflict with its non-git variant and
3. clone `$url` as a package source, to be placed into the `$srcdir` as `$pkgname`.
 - These can be overwritten by setting `$_giturl` and `$_gitname`, respectively, before inputting the template.
4. Also, [a `pkgver` function](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/VCS_package_guidelines#Git) will be inserted. It uses tags if available and automatically fall back to counting revisions otherwise.

To use it, [install this package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/git-makepkg-templates/), add a line like

```
# template input; name=git
```

to your PKGBUILD and process it with `makepkg-template`. See [the PKGBUILD of git-makepkg-templates itself](PKGBUILD) for an example.


## Template variants

The components are available in different granularities.

- If you only need a `pkgver` function and care for sources and dependencies yourself, just include [`git-pkgver`](git-pkgver.template).
- To achieve the inverse and just get points (1) to (3) of the above list, use [`git-source`](git-source.template).
- [`git-revcount`](git-revcount.template) provides even less and serves just a single line to generate a revision counting version. This should be prepended to version strings that are generated from information within the repository files, to clearly distinguish them from their non-git counterparts. Include it last in a relevant `pkgver` function, while the commands before finish up with a dot, omitting a trailing newline. For example, when the version is noted in a plain file called `version`, write

  ```bash
  pkgver() {
    cat version | tr "\n" "."
    # template input; name=git-revcount
  }
  ```

  It also does not append a newline, so after it, you may add further information, like branches, experimental state or similar.

- [The `git` template](git.template) provides everything combined.
